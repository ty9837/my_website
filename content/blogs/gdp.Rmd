We will use the GDP data from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP.

After making the data into long and tidy format, expressing all figures in billions, and renaming the indicators into something shorter, let's first compare GDP components for United States, India, and Germany.

```{r read_GDP_data, echo=FALSE}
UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"),
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr",
                skip=2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(col = ("1970":"2017"), names_to = "Year",values_to = "Value_bn") %>%
  transform(Value_bn = Value_bn/1e9) %>%
  transform(Year = as.numeric(Year))

tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Final consumption expenditure")] <- "Final_consumption_expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)")] <- "Household_expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure")] <- "Government_expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation")] <- "Gross_capital_formation"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables")] <- "Gross_fixed_capital_formation"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services")] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services")] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[which(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")] <-"GDP"
```

```{r fig.height=5}
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
components_GDP <- c("Household_expenditure","Gross_capital formation", "Government_expenditure", "Exports", "Imports")

tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% components_GDP & Country %in% country_list) %>%
  transform(IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c("Gross_capital_formation", "Exports", "Government_expenditure", "Household_expenditure", "Imports"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,y = Value_bn))+
  facet_wrap(vars(Country))+
  geom_line(aes(group = IndicatorName,color = IndicatorName))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())+
  scale_color_hue(name = "GDP Components",
                  labels = c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports"))+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$")
```

Next, let's calculate the % difference between calcualted GDP and the GDP from UN dataframe, which is shown in the table below (including avg, median, max and min).

```{r}
GDP_data_wider <- tidy_GDP_data[c(1,2,4,3,5)] %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = ("CountryID":"Value_bn"), names_from = "IndicatorName", values_from = "Value_bn") %>%
  select("CountryID":"Year","GDP","Household_expenditure","Gross_capital_formation","Government_expenditure","Exports","Imports") %>%
  mutate(Household_expenditure_percent = Household_expenditure/GDP,
         Gross_capital_formation_percent = Gross_capital_formation/GDP,
         Government_expenditure_percent = Government_expenditure/GDP,
         Net_export_percent = (Exports - Imports)/GDP,
         GDP_diff = (Household_expenditure + Gross_capital_formation + Government_expenditure + Exports - Imports - GDP)/GDP)

GDP_data_wider %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(Average = mean(GDP_diff),
            Median = median(GDP_diff),
            Max = max(GDP_diff),
            Min = min(GDP_diff)) %>%
  transform(Average = percent(Average),
            Median = percent(Median),
            Max = percent(Max),
            Min = percent(Min)) %>%
  kable(format = "html",caption = "GDP Difference in Percentage") %>%
  kable_classic()
```

The graph below depicts the overall trend in components of the GDP for India, USA, and Germany since 1970.

It can be seen that Germany’s household expenditure has contributed around 60% to its GDP and has remained fairly constant over the years. The contribution of its government expenditure as well as Gross capitak formation has also remained stable. However, in more recent years, the country’s net exports have started contributing more towards its GDP as Germany has increased its manufacturing sector.

On the other hand, contribution of household expenditure to India’s GDP has reduced over time and the Gross capital formation has increased. This is because India is developing rapidly and the government has made sure to invest in infrastructure. Net exports have also increased in the past few years and are predicted to contribute more to the GDP as India accelerates its spend in manufacturing.

Contribution of household expenditure in the US has increased over time. This is expected as it is a developed nation and discretionary income tends to be higher. Net exports have remained fairly stable as the US has had a falling manufacturing sector for years. Government expensiture has also fallen while overall gross capital formation has increased.

Now, let's do examine the GDP components for three other countries: Brazil, Australia, Belgium.
```{r fig.height=5}
country_list_2 <- c("Brazil","Australia", "Belgium")
components_GDP <- c("Household_expenditure","Gross_capital formation", "Government_expenditure", "Exports", "Imports")

tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% components_GDP & Country %in% country_list_2) %>%
  transform(IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c("Gross_capital_formation", "Exports", "Government_expenditure", "Household_expenditure", "Imports"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,y = Value_bn))+
  facet_wrap(vars(Country))+
  geom_line(aes(group = IndicatorName,color = IndicatorName))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())+
  scale_color_hue(name = "GDP Components",
                  labels = c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports"))+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$")
```

The graph depicts the overall trend in components of the GDP for Brazil, Australia, and Belgium since 1970.
All three economies have been growing and all components of the GDP have increased.Government Expenditure in Brazil and Australia have both increased drastically since 1970.This is because the government is trying to develop the economy in Brazil. Exports from Brazil have also increased as the agriculture industry has grown. 

Australia's gross capital formation has increased as the economy opened itself up over the years. Exports have also increased as the country became part of new trade deals. 
Belgium's household income has increased the most compared to all the other components. It moves extremely closely with the gross capital formation. Government expenditure has increased but not as quickly as the other countries. As Belgium si also part of the EU, it exports have also not grown as quickly.
